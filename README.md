# SkillsterAI 

This is a submission for the Samsung Prism GenAI hackathon 2024 by Sahnaaz Mariam and Lakshmanan of Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai. 

SkillsterAI, with its tagline 'making hobbies accessible' is a platform where anyone can easily adopt a hobby, progress from beginner to expert levels with guidance from our AI expert, and receive valuable feedback. Our mission is to democratize skill acquisition, making it both cost-free and readily available to all.
 
In our initial development phase, SkillsterAI concentrates on sports, dance, yoga, and gymnastics. We accomplish this by training a machine learning model with datasets containing movements performed by athletes and practitioners. These movements are then compared with the user's performance in the aforementioned hobbies using MediaPose pose detection technology, analyzing poses frame by frame. By providing detailed feedback based on this comparison, SkillsterAI empowers users to enhance their skills and proficiency levels in their chosen activities.
